### Demagnetizing Factors

The estimations for demagnetizing factors is based on
"Simple and approximate expressions of demagnetizing factors of uniformly magnetized rectangular rod and cylinder", by M. Sato and Y. Ishii,
published in "Journal of Applied Physics, Volume 66, Issue 2, July 15, 1989, pp.983-985".

### Screw Sizes

Additionally, [a chart of US screw sizes](./ref/screw_sizes.jpg) is included.
